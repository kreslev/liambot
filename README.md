# liambot
Liambot is a Discord bot that listens for certain ques and then responds with preprogrammed responses and actions.
It is broken into a few different files to create an ease of use.

main.py holds the needed files to get the bot running on discord. Here the listeners are set.

help.py holds some generic responses and is where simple prewritten responses should be stored.

emailSender.py builds an email based off of inputs and then sends it to the emails stored in its array.

liam.py handles the more complex responses.
